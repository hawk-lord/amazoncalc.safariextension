Drag a .png image file into your extension folder.
The image should ideally be 14x14 or 16x16 pixels.
The image is an alpha mask. It must contain an 8-bit alpha channel defining the part of the button face that is drawn, and nothing else.
You can include an alternate image at double the resolution for use on high-resolution displays. Use the same name for the alternate image file, but append the characters @2x. For example, if your image is named myToolBarImg.png, the high-resolution image should be named myToolBarImg@2x.png.
